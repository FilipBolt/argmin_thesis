\section*{Summary}

This thesis focuses on several tasks in argumentation mining
of claims. Argumentation mining studies argumentation
extraction from text. With the increase of internet use, 
internet discussions are becoming a valuable source of 
argumentation. Claims constitute the building blocks of
argumentation. 

This research proposes methods for mining topic-specific
argumentative claim analysis in internet discussions. Claims are
structured using a two-level ontology: an upper ontology and a 
domain ontology. The upper ontology is used to describe claim patterns.
The domain ontology models domain-specific concepts. 
Structuring claims allows for higher quality claim
analysis by relaxing the problem of language variance 
and allows for deriving implicit claims. 
Supervised machine learning methods are proposed to detect
and structure claims from internet discussions. 
A method for claim analysis is proposed to analyze
implicit claims of internet discussion participants.
