\chapter{Annotation guidlines}

- Manually annotated datasets are essential to build and evaluate argumentation 
mining models. \\
- high quality dataset annotation requires that annotators are well trained in the task at hand \\
- data should be consistently annotated between indepedently working annotators \\
- having quality labelled data is a necessary foundation to build machine learning 
models \\
- to ensure annotators are understand the assigment and are able to complete 
the annotation task successfully, good annotation guidelines are required \\
- during the annotation of data described in this thesis  
annotators had to do a test annotation before the real one, 
discuss differently annotated examples until resolution, and redo annotation of examples
where there was no consensus available  \\
- this chapter shows the annotation guidelines for \begin{enumerate}
\item microstructures (\ref{sec:microstructure_annotation_appendix}), 
\item argumentative segments (\ref{sec:argseg_annotation}),
\item claim formalizations (\ref{sec:formalization_annotation}), and
\item argument comment relationship pairs (\ref{sec:argrec_annotation}).
%TODO find annotation guidelines for implicit premiess (I think there are none)
%\item implicit premises (\ref{sec:arg_premises_annotation}). 
\end{enumerate}
