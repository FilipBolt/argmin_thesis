\chapter{Annotation guidlines}

- Manually annotated datasets are essential to build and evaluate argumentation 
mining models. \\
- high quality dataset annotation requires that annotators are well trained in the task at hand \\
- data should be consistently annotated between indepedently working annotators \\
- having quality labelled data is a necessary foundation to build machine learning 
models \\
- to ensure annotators are understand the assigment and are able to complete 
the annotation task successfully, good annotation guidelines are required \\
- during the annotation of data described in this thesis  
annotators had to do a test annotation before the real one, 
discuss differently annotated examples until resolution, and redo annotation of examples
where there was no consensus available  \\
- this chapter shows the annotation guidelines for \begin{enumerate*}
\item microstructures (\ref{sec:microstructure_annotation_appendix}), 
\item argumentative segments,
\item claim formalizations and
\item argument comment relationship pairs
\end{enumerate*}
