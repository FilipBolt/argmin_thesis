Here is the list of all the datasets created as part of this thesis.

\begin{enumerate}[label=\textbf{A.\arabic*}]
\item\label{item:comarg} \ComArg is a dataset of online user comments manually annotated with
comment-argument pairs. The dataset is created for the argument
recognition task: identifying what arguments, from a predefined
set of arguments, have been used in users' comments, and how.
It consists of 1285 and 1013 comment-argument pairs from 
on-line discussions of \emph{Gay Marriages} (GM) 
and \emph{Under God in pledge} (UGIP) respectively.
The dataset is publicly available at:

\item\label{item:argpresmises} ArgPremises is a dataset of 
implicit premises manually annotated on matching claims. 
The dataset is created to explore what are the implied premises users 
make when expressing support for a claim.
Additionally, it was used to help solve the claim matching task; 
using implicit premise information whilst 
identifying whether a pair of claims expresses the same argument. 
It consists of 494 claim pairs and 3977 respective premises on topics
of \emph{Marijuana Legalization} (MA), \emph{Gay Rights} (GA), 
\emph{Abortion Legalization} (AB),
and \emph{Obama Presidency} (OB).
The dataset is publicly available at:

\item\label{item:microstructures_dataset} The Claim Microstructure dataset contains posts split into claim
segments, translated into claim microstructures. The dataset is created
to explore how claims can be structured using a restricted
language and grammar. Additionally, it was used to help solve
the stance classification task; using claim microstructure
information when determining stance of a claim. 
The dataset consists of 
100 user posts on the \emph{Gay Rights} (GA) topic, 
split into 920 claim segments and paraphrases, annotated with
882 microstructures (A1) and 842 microstructures (A2), and a hierarchical 
list of 307 concepts used to form microstructures. 
The dataset is publicly available at:
