\chapter{Introduction}

- we argue every day; \\
- Whether it is a domestic discussion which color the bathroom should 
be painted with, a political TV show debate on how will the latest tax increase 
impact small businesses, or a discussion at work on which text editor makes
code editing the fastest arguments are used to convince the other discussion 
participant(s) to adhere to a single opinion. \\
- More formally, a dialogue or a conversation is defined as a goal-directed
conventional framework in which two partners reason 
together in an orderly way, 
according to the rules of politeness or normal exchange expectations
of cooperative argumentation for the type of exchange they are
engaged in \citep{walton1998new} \\
- defining argumentation goes back to Aristotle \\

- interest in argumentation started with computational argumentation, 
roughly with \citep{dung1995acceptability}

- Argument Mining is the automatic identification and extraction of the structure
of inference and reasoning expressed as arguments presented in natural language
\citep{lawrence2019argument} \\

\section{Argumentation Mining of Claims}

\section{Contributions}

The research aims to improve the state of
the art in argumentation mining by means of claim structuring and the
development of a computer system prototype for claim analysis, which would
allow for better understanding of argumentation in internet discussions. 
The prospective original scientific contribution consists of: 
\begin{enumerate}
\item A method for modeling of argumentation in internet discussions using an
two-level ontology, where the first level contains topic-specific knowledge,
while the second level models the claim patterns;
\item A computational method for detection and
structuring of claim in argumentative discourse based on supervised machine
learning;
\item A framework and a prototype of a system for computer-aided
analysis of claims in internet discussions which links together the detection,
structuring, and the analysis of claims.  
\end{enumerate}
