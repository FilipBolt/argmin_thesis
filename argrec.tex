\chapter{Prominent Claim Identification}

Prominent claim identification aims to determine which claims are predominately
used to express and base users' stance on. The task of prominent claim
identification has also been reffered to as \textit{argument-based opinion mining}
\citep{boltuzic2014back}, reason classification \citep{hasan2014you}, and
argument tagging \citep{sobhani2015argumentation}. 
The problem of prominent claim identification involves determining
the relationship between a comment a set of well-established prominent claims. 
Consider a discussion on the topic ``\emph{Should gay marriage be legal}''
and a following comment: 
\begin{quote}
\emph{
Gay marriages must be legal in all 50 states. A marriage is covenant
between 2 people regardless of their genders. Discrimination against
gay marriage is unconstitutional and biased. Tolerance,education and
social justice make our world a better place.
}
\end{quote}
This comment supports the claim ``\emph{It is discriminatory to refuse
gay couples the right to marry}'' and attacks the claim
``\emph{Marriage should be between a man and a woman}''. 
The technical challenge here lies in the fact that, unlike
in debates or other more formal, argumentation sources, 
claims provided by users are usually less formal, ambiguous, vague, 
implicit, or often simply poorly worded. 
The task of \textbf{prominent claim identification} is defined 
as identifying what prominent claims, from a predefined set of prominent claims, 
have been used in users' comments, and how. 
A topic-dependent set of prominent claims is assumed to exist. 
Users' comments typically contain more than one claim, but in their 
own wording and with varying degree of explicitness. 
The task of prominent claim identification amounts to matching
users' comments to prominent claims, which can be either attack or 
supported by the comment. 
The user comment may be a single prominent claim (and it often is), but it 
is reffered to as a \textit{comment} to emphasize the fact that in general 
it may contain several claims, as well as non-argumentative text. 

In this chapter, we first introduce the \ComArg corpus in section~\ref{sec:comarg}
which contains labelled pairs of comments with prominent claims. Next, 
we build a model for prominent claim identification as described in 
section~\ref{sec:argrec_model}. The model is evaluated in 
section~\ref{sec:argrec_experiments}. Finally, we conclude in 
section~\ref{sec:argrec_conclusion}.

\section{\ComArg corpus}
\label{sec:comarg}

- For training and evaluating argument recognition models,
we have compiled a corpus of user comments, manually annotated
with arguments which we refer to as \ComArg \\
- \ComArg is freely available
\footnote{Freely available under the CC BY-SA-NC license from \url{http://takelab.fer.hr/data/comarg}} \\
- as a source of data we use two websites: 
\emph{procon.org}\footnote{\url{http://www.procon.org}} and 
\textit{idebate.org}.\footnote{\url{http://idebate.org}} \\
The former is a discussion site covering ideological, social, political,
and other topics \\
- users express their personal opinions on a selected topic, taking either
the pro or con side. \\
The latter, \textit{idebate.org} is a debating website containing
online debates and an archive of past debates \\
- each archived topic contains a set of prominent claims 
presented in the debate \\
- each claim is labelled as either \textbf{for} or \textbf{against} the topic \\
- the claims are moderated and edited to provide the best quality of information \\

\noindent two datasources are completentary to each other as 
\textit{procon.org} contains user comments, while \textit{idebate.org} contains prominent 
claims \\
- we manually identified near-identical topics covered by both web sites \\
- we choose two topics: ``\textit{Under God in Pledge}'' (UGIP) and 
``\textit{Gay marriage}'' (GM). \\
- they have a larger-than-average number of comments (above 300) and are 
well-balanced between \textbf{pro} and \textbf{con} stances \\
- for these two topics, we then took the corresponding comments and prominent claims
from \textit{procon.org} and \textit{idebate.org} respectively \\
- as the users can produce comments not relevant to the topic, we skim-read 
the comments and omit non-argumentative comments \\
- we end up with a set of 175 comments and 6 arguments for UGIP, and 198 comments and 7 
arguments for the GM topic \\
- the comments are often verbose: the average number of words per comment is 116 \\
- each comment has an associated stance (\textbf{pro} or \textbf{con}) depending on 
how it was classified in \textit{procon.org} \\
- similarly, each prominent claim either attacks or supports the claim of the topic,
depending on how it was classified on \textit{idebate.org}, these claims will be reffered to 
as ``pro prominent claims'' and ``con prominent claims'' \\
- table~\ref{tab:comarg-claims} shows prominent claims for UGIP and GM topics \\

\end{table}


\noindent - users may attack or support both \textbf{pro} and \textbf{con} arguments \\
- we will refer to the way how the argument is \textit{used} (attacked or supported)
as prominent claim polarity \\
- typically, users who take the \textbf{pro} stance do so by supporting one of the \textbf{pro}
prominent claims, and perhaps attacking some of the \textbf{con} prominent claims, while
for users who take the \textbf{con} stance it is the other way around \\

%\subsection{Annotation}

\noindent - Annotation is done by labelling the prominent claims and polarity  
used in each comment \\
- we paired all comments with all possible prominent claims for the topic , resulting in
1,050 and 1,386 comment-prominent claim pairs for the UGIP and GM topics, respectively \\
- we then ask annotators to annotate each pair
\footnote{we initially attempted to crowdsource the annotation with guidelines listed in 
appendix~\ref{sec:argrec_annotation}. We used the same guidelines with expert annotators
to much greater success.}\\
- since user-provided claims are often vague or implicit, therefore we decided to 
annotate each comment-prominent claim using a five point scale shown in 
table~\ref{tab:comarg-labels} \\
- labels encode the presence (\textbf{A, a, s, S}) or absence (\textbf{N})
of a prominent claim in a comment, its polarity
(comment labelled \textbf{S} and \textbf{s} supports the prominent claim; comment labelled
\text{A} and \text{a} attacks the prominent claim)
, as well as degree of 
explicitness (\textbf{A} expresses attacking more explicitly than \textbf{a}; \textbf{S} expresses support
more explicitly than \textbf{s}) \\

\noindent - the annotatation was carried out by three trained annotators, in two
steps \\
- in the first step, each annotator indepedently annotated the complete dataset of 2,436 comment-prominent claim
pairs \\
- to improve annotation quality, we single out the problematic comment-prominent claim
pairs \\
- problematic pairs were found if 
\begin{enumerate*} 
\item there is no agreement among three annotators or
\item the ordinal distance between any of the labels assigned
by the annotators is greater than one. 
\end{enumerate*} \\
- Table~\ref{tab:problematic-comments} shows some examples of problematic comments \\
- Most problematic prominent claims are \textit{A1.3} and \textit{A1.5} for the UGIP topic
and prominent claims \textit{A2.1} and \textit{A2.7} for the GM topic (references
in table~\ref{tab:comarg-claims}) \\
- in the second step, we asked annotators to indepedently revise 
their decisions for the problematic comment-prominent claim pairs \\
- each re-annotated 515 pairs of which 86 were revised \\
- the annotation took around 30 person-hours \\

the five labels constitute an ordinal scale \\ 
- according to standard interpretation \citep{landis1977measurement} resulting
values ($\kappa = 0.49$) indicate moderate agreement 
- to obtain gold standard annotation, we took the majority label for 
each comment-prominent claim pair, discarding the pairs with ties \\

- among the cases not labelled as \textbf{N}, prominent claims are used explicitly 
in 58.4 \% (labels \textbf{A} and \textbf{S}) and vague/implicit (labels \textbf{a} and \textbf{s})
in 41.5\% of cases \\
- there is a difference across topics: in UGIP prominent claims are explicit in 55.3\%, while in 
GM in 60.7\% of cases \\
- there might be an effect on how the choice of predefined prominent claims along with their 
wording \\
- the average number of prominent claims in a comment is $1.9$ (1.8 for UGIP, 2.0 for GM) \\
- In GM, 62.8\% prominent claims are \textbf{pro}, while in UGIP \textbf{pro} claims 
make up 52.2\% cases \\

\section{Model}
\label{sec:argrec_model}

- we cast the prominent claim identification problem as a multiclass problem
(multiclass problems described in section~\ref{sec:unstruc_machine_learning}) \\
- given a comment-prominent claim pair as input, the classifier should
predict the correct label from the set of five possible labels (labels
listed in table~\ref{tab:labels}) \\
- the classifier should rely on the features derived from the comparison
of the comment and prominent claim \\
- this approach, ideally, should be less domain-dependent than using features
directly from the comment or prominent claim \\
- three kinds of features are used: \begin{enumerate*}
\item textual entailment (TE) features, 
\item semantic text similarity (STS) features, and
\item ``stance alignment'' (SA) features. 
\end{enumerate*}
- textual entailment is described in section~\ref{sec:textual_entailment} \\
- semantic textual similarity is described in section~\ref{sec:sts} \\
- ``stance alignment'' is a binary feature whose value is set to one if a
\textbf{pro} comment is paired with a \textbf{pro} prominent claim or if a
\textbf{con} comment is paired with a \textbf{con} prominent claim.  This SA
feature presupposes that comment stance is known a priori. \\

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics{entailment.pdf}
\caption{Ratio of positive entailment decisions across labels, scaled to a $[0,1]$ interval
}
\label{fig:entailment_ratio}
\end{figure}

% entailment
- Following the work of \citet{cabrio2012combining}, we use textual 
entailment to determine whether the comment (text) entails the prominent
claim (hypothesis) \\
- to this end, we use the Excitement Open Platform (EOP)
\citep{pado2015design} \\
- from EOP, we used seven pre-trained \textit{entailment decision algorithms}
(EDAs) \\
- some EDAs use only syntactical features, whereas others rely on
WordNet \citep{miller1995wordnet}, VerbOcean \citep{chklovski2004verbocean} \\
- each EDA outputs a binary decision (\textit{Entailment} or \textit{NonEntailment})
along with a degree of confidence \\
- we use all seven (decisions and confidences) of EDAs as features for our classifier 
(14 features in total) \\
- we experiment with additional features (the disjunction of all classifier decisions, 
max of seven EDA confidence values, mean value of seven EDA confidences), but those
did not impact performance \\
- the motivation for this set of features is that we expect the comment text (usually longer and specific)
to entail the prominent claim (usually shorter and more general) \\
- this intuition is confirmed in figure~\ref{fig:entailment_ratio}
where it shown that 
pro prominent claims have a higher ratio of positive entailment decisions than con prominent claims \\
- also vaguely supported prominent claims have a lower rate of entailment
decisions than explicitly supported prominent claims \\

% semantic textual similarity
- the prominent claim should either be entailed or not entailed from the comment \\
- the former case includes a paraphrase \\
- in the latter case, there might be a contradiction or it may be \textit{non sequitur} \\
- these relations can be hard to detect, especially from vaguely stated comments \\
- to account for this, we use a feature based on semantic textual similarity (STS) \\
- we use TakeLab's STS \citep{vsaric2012takelab} which works as described in
section~\ref{sec:sts} \\
